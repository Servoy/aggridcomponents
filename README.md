# NG Grids

NG Grids package contains two advanced table components which provides built-in grouping functionalities: Data Grid (https://github.com/Servoy/aggridcomponents/wiki/Data-Grid) that uses as data model Servoy foundsets, ideal for large amount of data, and Power Grid (https://github.com/Servoy/aggridcomponents/wiki/Power-Grid), that uses as data model Servoy datasets, better suited for small data, as it's loads the data model in memory.
